Spoticromos transforms the music you already love into something you can collect, play, and share. Connect your Spotify account, import your playlists, and watch your tracks become collectible cards spanning five rarity tiers — from Common all the way to Legendary.

## How It Works

1. **Connect** your Spotify account
2. **Import** any of your playlists as a collection
3. **Play** mini-games to earn card packs
4. **Collect** every track across all five rarity tiers
5. **Share** your progress with friends

## Collect

Every track in a collection becomes a card featuring its album art, artist photo, and metadata. Cards come in five rarities — **Common**, **Uncommon**, **Rare**, **Epic**, and **Legendary** — each progressively harder to find. Complete a collection by owning every track at every rarity level.

Manage your cards with three actions:

- **Merge** two copies of the same rarity to upgrade to the next tier
- **Recycle** three copies to spawn new random cards
- **Stick** a favorite card to protect it from merging or recycling

## Play

Earn card packs by playing two music-themed mini-games built from your collection's actual tracks.

### Trivia

Test your music knowledge with dynamically generated questions — guess release years, identify albums by their cover, finish lyrics, compare artist popularity, and more. Build streaks for score multipliers and try to beat your highscore.

### Pairs

A memory matching game using album covers and artist images from your collection. Clear the board to advance to larger grids with increasing difficulty.

### Free Claims

Not in the mood to play? Claim a free card pack every 10 minutes per collection.

## Share

Browse other users' collections, check out their progress, and discover new music through what they're collecting. Every user has a public profile showing their unlocked collections and completion status.

## Built On Spotify

Spoticromos uses real data from your Spotify library — your playlists, your artists, your albums. It's your music, gamified.
